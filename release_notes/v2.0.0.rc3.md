# Jasmine Gem 2.0 Release Notes

These notes cover version 2.0.0.rc3

## Summary

This release is focused on support for Jasmine 2.0, gem configuration simplification, and improvement of Rails support (including Rails 4).

The `Jasmine.configure` block now allows for fine-tuned configuration of how a project's suite is run. There are two new/refined concepts: Runners and Formatters.

Formatters are responsible for taking the results from the Jasmine suite and presenting the data in a specific format. Runners take a URL and a Formatter and are responsible for running the Jasmine suite and passing results to the given formatter.

The default Runner uses PhantomJS to run the suite. The default Formatter sends results to the console. There are Ruby gems for a [Selenium/Webdriver Runner][selenium] and a [JUnit XML Formatter][junit]. These projects are great examples for writing a Runner or Formatter for your environment.

## Dropped Support

* _Most_ ENV variables removed - use `Jasmine.configure` to set browser, ports, etc.
* Dropped support for 1.8.x Rubies, Rails 2, RSpec 1 - please continue to use Jasmine gem 1.3.2
* "self-test" is gone as [Jasmine core now tests itself](http://travis-ci.org/pivotal/jasmine)
